# TweetContract

`TweetContract` is a Solidity smart contract that allows users to create and manage tweets, send direct messages, and follow other users. This contract can be used as the backbone for a decentralized microblogging platform on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Tweeting**: Users can post tweets, which are stored on-chain.
- **Messaging**: Users can send direct messages to each other.
- **Following**: Users can follow other accounts.
- **Operators**: Users can grant access to other addresses to tweet or send messages on their behalf.

## Contract Structure

### State Variables

- `tweets`: Mapping from tweet ID to `Tweet` struct.
- `tweetsOf`: Mapping of each user to their list of tweet IDs.
- `conversations`: Mapping of each user to their array of `Message` structs.
- `operators`: Mapping to manage operator permissions for users.
- `following`: Mapping of users to the list of accounts they follow.
- `nextId`: Counter for tweet IDs.
- `nextMessageId`: Counter for message IDs.

### Structs

- `Tweet`: Represents a tweet with an ID, author, content, and timestamp.
- `Message`: Represents a direct message with an ID, content, sender, recipient, and timestamp.

### Functions

- `sendMessage(string memory _content, address _to)`: Sends a message from the sender to another address.
- `sendMessage(address _from, address _to, string memory _content)`: Allows an operator to send a message on behalf of a user.
- `follow(address _followed)`: Follows a specific address.
- `allow(address _operator)`: Grants tweet/message access to another address.
- `disallow(address _operator)`: Revokes tweet/message access from an address.
